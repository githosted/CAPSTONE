# Phase 2 Project


![carsin](./img/carsin.jpg)

 

## Project Overview
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

For this project, I will be accessing car sales data in a csv format that contains the make, model, year, mileage and color of the vehicle. 
The data science process used to address this issue will be the OSEMIN model.



## Business Problem
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Used Car Lot TM is a newly established local business in the United States.They have advised that they are seeking to understand what are the top make and model of cars that sold the most in the last year nationally. From this analysis we intend on building a multiple linear regression model to predict what brand names will make the list.

The car lot intends on using this information to ensure their buisness objectives, marketing, and sales teams' concentrations are on point.

In addition, the information obtained will also be used to educate their staff and sales team. When approached by consumers looking to buy a used car, facts and statistics may assist all those involved. 

 

## The Data

**OBTAIN** 

This project contains the King County House Sales dataset, which is found in kc_house_data.csv of the data folder in this repo. The description of the column names can be found in column_names.md in the same folder. If we were to expand the regional database or have more rows of data over time, we could enlarge the model and have more information to work with, creating a stronger prediction with more concrete evidence based details to present to King County. See https://finance.zacks.com/property-size-increase-home-value-9809.html to validate the strength of the lot theoretical versus the grade of a home to ensure that the real world approach to this research and data project has been approached validly. 

**SCRUB**

The following methods were utilised to clean or "scrub" the data: Removed duplicates, drop unnecessary columns, removed null values, created lambda functions to remove exponential values, declared variables, dealt with outliers, set up column data to suit the business problem that made the most logical sense according to the business problem, and created data frames. Normalizing data and careful reviewed the data to purposefully address the buisness problem in a logical way. Descriptive statistics were also imperative at this point. *Normalizing the data was performed here aswell, however is depicted after some exploratory analysis. 

Features Ommited:



Features Included:



**EXPLORE**

Exploratory Statistical analysis used was: KDE - Kernal Density Estimate was used to obtain PMF - Probability Mass Function, z- Test conducted, P Value derived, R squared Value via OLS was reviewed and in alignment within normal range of 0.493 and Mean Standard Error - MSE and Cross Validation,

**MODEL**

Graphical representations used are in the forms of scatter plots, histograms, linear regression best line of fit using Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib, mapped residuals to confirm alternate hypothesis. 

**INTERPRET**
